    ~MAIN NOTES~

        INCOSE definition of -system- is: 
            -a construct or collection of different elements that together produce results not obtainable by the elements alone (e.g. a bicycle)
                -elements can include people, hardware, software, facilities, policies, and documents (all things required to produce systems-level results)
                -the results include system-level qualities, properties, characteristics, functions, behavior, and performance

        CRITICAL SYSTEM ESSENTIALS

            SAFETY - system should not harm people or system's environment
            AVAILABILITY - system must be available to deliver services when requested
            RELIABILITY - system must operate without serious failures
            SECURITY - system must be able to protect itself and its data from malicious use
            RESILIENCE - ability to resist and recover from damaging events
