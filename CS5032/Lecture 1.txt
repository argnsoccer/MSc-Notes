    ~MAIN NOTES~

        INCOSE definition of -system- is: 
            -a construct or collection of different elements that together produce results not obtainable by the elements alone (e.g. a bicycle)
                -elements can include people, hardware, software, facilities, policies, and documents (all things required to produce systems-level results)
                -the results include system-level qualities, properties, characteristics, functions, behavior, and performance

        CRITICAL SYSTEM ESSENTIALS

            SAFETY - system should not harm people or system's environment
            AVAILABILITY - system must be available to deliver services when requested
            RELIABILITY - system must operate without serious failures
            SECURITY - system must be able to protect itself and its data from malicious use
            RESILIENCE - ability to resist and recover from damaging events

        CLASSES OF CRITICAL Systems

            Safety-critical systems
                failure results in loss of life, injury or damage to the evnironment e.g. chemical plant protection system

            Mission-critical systems
                failure results in failure of some goal-directed activity e.g. spacecraft navigation

            Business-critical systems
                failure results in high economic losses e.g. banking

            Infrastructure systems
                failure results in loss of Infrastructure capability e.g. power

        CRITICAL SYSTEMS STACK

                    Critical System X     External Systems

                        Operating Systems and middleware

        SYSTEM DEPENDENCIES

        Independent critical Systems
            infrastructure,hardware is part of the system
            system operation is not dependent on external systems
            embedded control systems such as in medical devices

        Critical Software systems
            usually rely on commodity hardware/OS
            System operation is dependent on external infrastructure provision
            hopsital appts system

        primary critical systems - systems where system failure leads directly to an incident that has an associated loss of some kind
        secondary critical systems - systems whose failure may but need not lead to fialure in an associated system that then leads to loss of some kind

        certification costs can exceed dev costs


    ~~CASE STUDY - KEGWORTH AIR CRASH 1989~~

    
    engine is a system inside the system of the plane
    engine failure/not displayed well enough on dials/insufficient training
    CAA did not accept any of the suggestions
