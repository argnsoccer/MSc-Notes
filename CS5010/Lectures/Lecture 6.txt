Tree vs Network
Tree - goal state = leaf node
Network - goal state = weight config
Planning vs Learning
Rule Sequence vs Association

                            As we learn more about the brain as a bioelectric &chemical machine, we also progress AI


Aside - can we make AI "feel" hormones and emotions (amygdala, hippocampus)
