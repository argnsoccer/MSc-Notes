Neural Net Intro

Can Neural Nets or Symbolic AI provide intentional and meaningful behavior?

Neural Nets - association, classification, recognition (how do they relate to one another?)

Connectionism - Parallel Distributed Processing - Neural Nets (All same thing)
    PDP - speed
    learn by example
    not really like the brain atm 
    adaptable connections 

Symbolic AI
    Pros:
        execute anything expressed as sequence of formal rules
        Large amount of memory can be copied and retrieved accurately
        processing is realtively fast and highly accurately
    Cons:
        maybe not everything can be expressed as following sequence of formal rules
        retrieval of memories is brittle in being all or none
        many real world situations are novel and require adaptation faster than pres-set actions

Parallel vs serial
    brain - 10e11 neurons and more connections and potential connections
        performs better in vision, speech, motor control, facial recognition than sophisticated computer systems
        organisation impleneted with artificial processors would be a very powerful system that may be able to perform tasks such as vision and sopeech (easy for humans)
    
Content Addressable Memory for flexible memory retrieval
    memory retrieval is based on content not form (like humans)

Commonly used activation functions
    step function
    sigmoid (differentiable to home in on what we want)

feedforward architecture - supervised learning

strictly layered - pass connections strictly forward not laterally (which when included is called a recurrent network)
