Practical 2:
    research on chess, backgammon, Go
    chess - symbolic ai look ahead and expert systems
    backgammon - neural nets
    one more suited to self play than the other


Recurrent networks capable of creating internal states through cyclic connections
    can "store" state through cycles (t-1 is input then it is output back at t)

Feedforward nets only capable of I/O 

deep learning in time as well as space
