1.) cannibals and missionaries problem is a deep problem, making it harder to solve
    

2.) straight line greedy bfs works better than A*

3.) d -> adding the blank to the manhattan distance makes the manhattan distance inadmissible due to overestimation
        if don't add the blank into manhattan it could works

    c -> always the same

    e -> right

    expand in same order as russel & norvig

    is it possible to have an 8 puzzle state that leads to an infinite loop?
        Yes, encounter a repeated state... subtree is the same as earlier state

4.) a -> A* performs well where cost does not decrease monotonically always
        Greedy bfs performs well in straight line (where cost decreases monotonically always)

    b.) greedy non-optimal in false start & oscillation
        superior to A* in straight line

5.) depends on your opinion of "uninformed" search (r&n says uniform is uninformed)

6.) a -> infinite state space and infinite paths
    b -> visibility or straight line vertex-to-vertex or euclidean distance
